Experience unparalleled sound quality with SubZone - the ultimate app for optimizing your subwoofer's position. Simply enter the details of your room and listening position, and our advanced acoustic simulation will find the sweet spot. The result is clear, well-defined, deep bass that brings the very best out of music and movies.

When sound waves reflect off the walls, ceiling, and floor of a room they produce "room modes". These affect the sound by boosting or cutting certain frequencies, making some sound too boomy and others not present enough. To get the best performance out of your subwoofer, it is important to position it in a location that minimizes the effect of room modes.

Previously, finding the best place to put a subwoofer has involved trial-and-error or expensive acoustic software. Some even suggest crawling around on your hands and knees to listen for the area with the strongest room modes. Now, SubZone allows you to calculate the optimal position in a scientific and affordable way from the comfort of your seat.
