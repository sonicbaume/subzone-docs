# Simulation

This screen will be shown while the simulation is running, with the estimated time remaining. You can cancel the simulation by pressing back, however all progress will be
lost if you do.

## Long processing time

Some users may receive a warning that the simulation will take a long time. The duration
of the simulation depends on the size and reverberation of your room.

A simulation is run for each possible position of the subwoofer in the room, so the
bigger the room, the more simulations there are. Each simulation runs until the
reverberation drops below a certain threshold, so the more reberant the space, the
longer each simulation takes.

The processing time can be reduced by selecting construction materials that are more
absorbant at low frequencies, such as insulated stud walls/ceilings. However, if the
selected materials do not match those of your listening space, the results will not
be accurate.
