# Subwoofer zones

---

Once the simulation is complete, the results are displayed as a map of your room, divided into colored zones.

The color of each zone represents the quality of the sound you would experience at the selected listening position(s),
if the subwoofer was put in that zone. Blue indicates high quality and red indicates low quality. The highest quality
zones are marked with a star icon.

> What to do
>
> Try to move your subwoofer to a position marked with a star. Failing that, you should try to move it to the bluest zone that is appropriate.

## Detailed view
You can select a zone by pressing on it, which will move the subwoofer icon to that zone.
The detailed view at the bottom displays the score, location, and frequency response of the selected zone.

The score value (â˜…) is what determines the color of the zone. It is calculated by analysing the frequency response(s) of the
selected listening position(s) to measure how flat and smooth it is. The flattest, smoothest responses get a score of 10/10.

The other two values display the distance of the zone from the walls of the room. You can use these to position your subwoofer accurately.

The plot at the bottom is the frequency response produced by the simulation. It shows how the levels of each sound frequency would change
at the selected listening position(s) if the subwoofer was placed in the selected zone. The plot shows the gain in dB on a logarithmic scale, between 20 and 300 Hz.

## Multiple listening positions
Initially, the zones are only calculated for a single listening position. If you have multiple seats in your room, or listen from more
than one position, then you can add these by pressing the "Add position" button. You will be brought to the
[listening position setup](../listening-position-setup/) page to enter the measurements of the location. When you're done,
the simulation will be run for that position and the zones will be updated.

You can select or deselect a listening position by clicking on the buttons just below the zone map. If more than one listening position is selected,
the zones will change to show subwoofer locations that provide the best overall sound quality for the chosen positions.
The detailed view will overlay the frequency responses of the selected listening positions, each matching the color of the position's icon.

You can remove a listening position by pressing the "x" icon to the right of it's button just below the zone map.
