SubZone calculates the best position for your subwoofer by simulating the acoustics of your room.
To do this accurately, you will need to provide the following information about your room:
- Dimensions (width, length and height)
- Construction materals

## Add a room

When you first use SubZone, you will be automatically presented with the *Add room* screen (see right).
Subsequenty, you can add more rooms by pressing the '+' button in the bottom-right of the *Rooms* screen.

### Room name
Give the room a name - you can call it whatever you like ðŸ™‚

### Dimensions
Enter the width, length, and height of your room. The accuracy of the results will depend on these measurements,
so we suggest you measure the room yourself using a tape measure or laser distance measure, rather than trying to guess.

We suggest you measure to within 10cm, or 4 inches, of the actual room dimensions for the best results.
If your walls are not entirely flat, measure the distance between the two biggest surface areas of each wall.

Width and length can be used interchangeably.

### Construction materials
The materials used to construct your room affect its acoustic absorption, which in turn affect the size
of various room modes. To model the acoustics of your room, we need to estimate the acoustic absorption
of your walls, ceiling, and floor. We have made this as simple as possible by producing a list of the most common
construction materials for you to choose from.

As we're dealing with bass frequencies, we're only interested in what materials your room is constructed from
(e.g. brick), rather than what materials are on the surface (e.g. plaster), as the surface materials don't have
much effect on low-frequency absorption.

> Top tip
> 
> If you're unsure about your room's contruction materials, knock on your wall/ceiling/floor.
> Uninsulated stud walls/joists will sound hollow; insulated stud walls/joists will make a dull thud;
> and brick/concrete will make very little sound.

If you can't find a suitable material to choose from, or you're really not sure what the room is constructed
of, you can select the "Other / not sure" option. This will use an average of typical rooms.

When you're finished, press the 'next' button to [add a listening position](../listening-position-setup).
