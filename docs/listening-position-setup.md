# Listening position setup

---

The modes of a room vary depending on where you are within the room. To account for this, we need
to know where you will be listening from.

## Add a listening position

The "Add listening position"screen will appear after you enter your room details, or when you press
"Add listening position" from the results screen.

### Elevation
The elevation is the distance from the floor to your ears. You may find it easier to use a tape measure to
find the distance between your ears and the ceiling, and subtract that from the room height.

### Map view
The box below show a top-down view of your room. Move the ear icon to match your listening position in
the room. The numbers at the top and left display the distances between the selected position and the walls.

When you're finished, press 'done' to [run the simulation](../simulation).
